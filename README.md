# unity-tute-observer-pattern
 
 The Observer Pattern is a design pattern that enables an object (the subject) to notify multiple other objects (the observers) about changes in its state. This is especially useful in Unity for managing events, such as updating UI elements when a player's health changes, or triggering sound effects when certain conditions are met.

Pros and Cons of the Observer Pattern </br>
</br>
 Pros </br>
   Decouples subjects and observers, making the code modular and reusable.</br>
   Scales well as you add more observers.</br>
   Simplifies event-driven programming.</br>
   </br>
 Cons </br>
   Requires careful subscription and unsubscription to avoid memory leaks.</br>
   Debugging can be harder as you may have multiple listeners responding to the same event.</br>
